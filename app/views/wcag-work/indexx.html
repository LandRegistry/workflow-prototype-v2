(Including it within the HTML DOM by using JavaScript to inject it into the page - and then adding its listening on -change event - is preferable to relying upon CSS to “display none”).

              Assuming the issues in ticket #3377 are resolved (as they share features), these are the additional updates required to resolve accessibility issues concerning the auto-complete functionality (which are largely resolved by using an alternative auto-complete component). 
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body-s">
              The current auto-complete functionality on the 'Find' and 'Assign' text fields fail accessibility tests. These failings have been recorded in ticket Jira #<a href="https://hmlandregistry.atlassian.net/browse/AMW-1714" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" target="_blank">1714</a>, and this work resolves this issue. This alternative uses a Gov GDS project/component designed to be accessible. 
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body-s">
              The current auto-complete functionality dynamically displays the message "This user cannot obtain applications in Workflow" when it does not recognise or match the input to a name. The new text for this scenario - demonstrated in the HTML design - instead uses the GDS standard message of "No results found". (This is editable).
            </p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
              Steps to update the page HTML to work with the new accessibility compliant auto-complete component:
            </h2>

            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number govuk-list--spaced govuk-!-font-size-16">
              
              <li>
                Remove legacy SPAN elements (with class 'spin') in both input search fields and the redundant DIV with ID #results-container
              </li>
              <li>
                Move the input text fields into a noscript HTML tag as per the HTML design templates provided. (These will be used to maintain the current functionality and submit searches for uses without JavaScript support)
              </li>
              <li>
                To ensure these styles only target this instance (and cannot contaminate other pages/forms used in the service) as per the HTML design template provided - we add class "hmlr-wf-button-auto-complete" to the buttons on the searches and we add this CSS to the CSS output: <br>

                <pre>
                    .govuk-button.hmlr-wf-button-auto-complete {
                      top: -40px;
                    }
                    .js-enabled .govuk-button.hmlr-wf-button-auto-complete {
                      top: auto;
                    }
                    body:not(.js-enabled) .autocomplete-wrapper {
                      display: none; 
                    }
                </pre>
                
                <br>
                Also, we add the standard GDS class of "govuk-!-padding-left-0" to each instance of an input field with the class "search-bar" on this page.

              </li>
              <li>
                Add the new HTML blocks (identified by the classes 'manage-bar search-container') as per the HTML design provided; these are where the generated auto-complete and new input field is injected
              </li>
              <li>
                The auto-complete component:

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced govuk-!-font-size-16">
                  <li>
                    We require the component's JavaScript and CSS: For this prototype I have added the JavaScript and CSS required by this auto-complete component to the bottom of the HTML template file. (We could move the block of CSS to a separate CSS file). The JavaScript could be moved to a standalone file (as we may reuse it elsewhere); however the two ('#tt-autoselect' and '#tt2-autoselect') local declarations could remain as part of this file/page. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We can source minified CSS and JavaScript files - if required. It is also available via npm and a module system.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The hardcoded array of names (var namesExamples) used at the bottom of the HTML design file, provides the sample search data for the HTML design example. The component's documentation identifies where we can “Provide your remote data source” (commented in the HTML design file). The API provides further 'remote source' documentation.
                  </li>
                </ul>

The current behaviour uses JavaScript to alter the button state (making it disabled) and dynamically changing the button text to "Please wait ...". We need to remove the JavaScript which executes this from the build (as it is not required). Instead, the button will function unhindered and submit the request, with the page then returned with the updated content (exactly as it currently behaves without JavaScript) <br>

              <li><b>To discuss with the delivery team:</b> to replace the behaviour currently executed via a non-accessible JavaScript event, we want to determin if it is possible to set a timeout limit on this response. For example, if we are unable to serve a response/page within 8 seconds then we instead return the current page with a notfication banner included as per this design (and as per the HTML): <a href="./my-worklist-timed-out.html" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" target="_blank">My Worklist timed out</a>.

            <br>
            When the 'Obtain' button is not required in the page, we currently still include the HTML but add a 'hidden' attribute. Ideally we should not include the redundant HTML when it isn't required, but alternatively we should not use the 'hidden' attribute (or the 'hidden' class in the class declarations), and instead simply update the type attribute to 'hidden' (when this element is not required).

          </li>
          <li>

          <li>The obtain button sits in a form element: add the 'novalidate' attribute to the form element. We should also add 'novalidate' to the 'Open' buttons forms.

          <li>My Worklist: When there are zero Worklist applications in the Worklist application list the page still includes a table and nested THead set: if the number of Worklist applications is zero we do not want to include any table HTML.</li>

          <li>
            When there are zero Worklist applications, the following HTML is included in the page (which also has complications for assitive technologies regarding the 'hidden' attribute): we can remove this.<br>
            <pre>

              &lt;/div&gt;
            </pre>
          
          </li>
          <li>On the hyperlink 'Change your category of work': remove the title attribute from this link and add class 'govuk-link--no-visited-state' to the 'govuk-link' class</li>
          <li>On the 'More Info' links: we need to make each instance unique; this is done by adding the hidden context within each link, as per the HTML design</li>

            There are hidden input elements (used for maintaining states) and menu "links" (which are input elements) which are hidden (as they aren't always required in the menu): these are currently hidden using a 'hidden' CSS class and a 'hidden' attribute. These should be updated to instead utilse the type attribute which is changed to 'hidden'. <br><br>
            On the hidden input elements (for maintaining states); remove the CSS 'hidden' and 'hidden' attribute and change the type to 'hidden'.<br<br>
            For the "links", with are hidden according to context, instead of using CSS 'hidden' classes and 'hidden' attributes to hide them (when not required), we should update the type status to 'hidden' instead.

              <li>The solution, as recently implimented in Manage Assigned Work, is: the link submits (a hidden input value) to itself for the page to simply reload with the previously hidden table row(s), or applications, now showing in the page (by not including the inline 'hidden' attribute, and vice versa). i.e., a round trip post to the server to include or omit these attached application rows. (The plus &amp; minus and show/hide words in the hyperlink would also be updated by simply hardcoding them in the page output). </li>
              <li><i>This resolves the accessibility issue. If means the related JavaScript should then be removed from the build. </i></li>
              <li><i>Note: the HTML example does not demonstrate the current Show/Hide functionality - this needs to be observed on the Preview service where there is an application with an attached application. </i></li>

            <b>Update banner messages: </b>there is currently the behaviour of showing confirmation panels (within the page) confirming if and when applications have been updated (for example, 'progress later'); see list below. This relies upon JavaScript and it is a known issue that these updates often lag in time significantly and typically cause confusion when they are 'fired/served' inappropriately when the user has already instigated a different action on a different application. The use of JavaScript to impliment this is also non-accessible. 
            
            <br><br>

            We wish to propose (investigate) changing how this functionality is executed. Instead, when the page is refreshed (reloaded) we <a href="./my-worklist-obtain-success-obtained.html" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" target="_blank">use a standard GDS notification banner</a> added to the top of the page. (The current messages are rehoused in the new notification banner, as is, and as demonstrated). However, this issue remains that the action may not have completed before the page is returned?

                      <li>Instead we will implement conventional GDS form validation: a selection is required “Select a deferral reason” (as per error message HTML design)</li>

                        <li>Clicking the error summary statement should move the browser focus to the first radio button option at the top of the list</li>

                          <li>GDS error messages, include: doc title prepended with “Error: “, left red bar, summary banner, inline error message, aria-describedby on fieldset linked to the inline error message</li>

                            <li>If not already - remove the hidden 'noscript' HTML block (which includes the message “You must have JavaScript turned on to use this page")</li>

                              <li>Add 'novalidate' to the form tag</li>

                                <li>Ensure the page structure matches the HTML design: grid-row and column-two-thirds</li>

                                  <li>This may no longer be required as ticket #3746 (which reformatted the banners to use an aria-live Section element), but the DIV (with classes 'govuk-error-summary half-width') located below the main H1 should now not be needed having been replaced with the recent update. </li>

        <p class="govuk-body-s">1). The basic page: changes to the UI structure:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced govuk-!-font-size-16">
          <li>Add the GDS grid system, using 'govuk-grid-column-three-quarters' on this page (as per the HTML design example)</li>

          <li>Due to the nature of the existing page/form design - with grouped radio button options along with inline sub-headings - this HTML on this page should be restructured using nested Fieldsets (as per the HTML design example). i.e., Each of the 5 groups sit within their own Fieldset (with Legends), placed within the one parent Fieldset (using a H1 header within a legend), as per the new HTML design. [This structure is also required to support the GDS error message logic]. </li>

            <li>Add 'novalidate' to the form tag</li>

              <li>Individual abbreviations within the form labels should be wrapped in an ABBR tag. (Sometimes there are double or triple abbreviations, such as <abbr>VCO</abbr> <abbr>ADR</abbr> in a single label)</li>

                <li>Note: because we can only use one 'div.govuk-form-group' to wrap all the Fieldsets (for the GDS error message styling) we need to add the margin-bottom class to each Fieldset (and a margin class on the main H1 tag, or parent legend)</li>

                  <li>While we're here, we'll also take the opportunity to simply add the 'govuk-radios--small' style class to the radio buttons list to reduce the size of the radio buttons - because the list of options is so long/extensive and because the GDS design system recommends it: "Small radios can work well on information dense screens in services designed for repeat use, like case-working systems."</li>
         
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body-s">2). The error message: implement form validation: On the preview site, there doesn't appear to be any form validation on this page? (The page simply redirecting to the workflow page isn't accessibility compliant).</p>

        <p class="govuk-body-s">Selecting an option is a requirement. If not selection is made we refresh the page with a GDS error message (all as per the HTML design): </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced govuk-!-font-size-16">
          <li>“Error: “ is prepended to the document title</li>

          <li>An error summary banner is placed at the top of the page</li>
          
          <li>The hyperlink in the error summary banner moves focus to the first radio option</li> 
          
          <li>An inline error message repeats the summary banner message</li>
          
          <li>An aria describedby attribute is added to the parent Fieldset which targets the ID on the inline error message</li>
          
          <li>Red styling is added to the left of the form options</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p class="govuk-body-s">3). Notification banner: ensure the action is fed back: </p>

          <p class="govuk-body-s">When the user submits the form they are returned to the Worklist page where a notification banner is included - as per the design - confirming success.  The dynamic content as currently used, remains unchanged, but the HTML has been updated, as per the design. The statement text has been updated to include the word 'now' (as per the design) and the space before the colon in the title is removed (as per the design).  We are also removing the hyperlink 'Change your category of work' which currently features in the confirmation banner (as this is repeated directly below, is not part of the confirmation banner function, and the duplication creates a new set of accessibility issues).</p>
