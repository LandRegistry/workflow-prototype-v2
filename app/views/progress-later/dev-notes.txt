    -A lawyer is required to further the application

    Yeah I believe so, other than <REFFERER> and <REASSIGNER> which would be replaced with the name of the referrer and reassigner
 
the default value for referrer (if the case worker isn't in the cache or active directory) is "new caseworker"  
 
and the default for reassigner is "Manager"
 
so it would appear in the column as for example "Consider referral from new caseworker" or "Consider assignment from Darren Harridence" etc
