1). 'hmlr-no-wrap' class added to the 'a' link for "Change your category of work" 

sass: 

@include govuk-media-query($from: desktop){
    .hmlr-no-wrap {
        white-space: nowrap;
    }
}


2). Note the hidden content and HTML (fieldset/legend), etc

3). Note 'abbr' tag for ADR inside the form label (if the label is ADR)

4). If a 'cancelled' ADR application is selected and a 'cancelled' case is not available, we fallback to serving a non-cancelled ADR case AND the success banner includes the additional text sentence, as demonstrated in the prototype.

5). ADR radio is pre-selected
